# Student Information Management System

An interactive application to manage school class student information using a Binary Search Tree.

## Summary

This project is an application to maintain detailed information for school classes. For each student, the following data is stored: a unique student ID, student name, home address (city), class ID, and date of enrollment. The system leverages a Binary Search Tree data structure to efficiently manage and retrieve student records, providing an effective tool for the school secretary.

## Specifications

The application should perform the following tasks:

1. **Insert a Student:**  
   Add a new student along with all the associated data.

2. **Find and Update a Student:**  
   Search for a student by their unique student ID. If found, allow the secretary to update the student’s information.

3. **List All Students:**  
   Display all students in lexicographic order based on their names.

4. **Search by City:**  
   Search for a city and list all students from that city in lexicographic order of their names.

5. **List Students by Class:**  
   List all students enrolled in a specific class, ordered lexicographically by their names.

6. **Delete a Student:**  
   Remove a student’s record from the system using their student ID.

7. **Save to File:**  
   Save all student records to a file named `students.data`.

8. **Load Existing Data:**  
   If the file `students.data` exists, automatically load its contents when the program starts.

9. **Exit:**  
   Terminate the program gracefully.
